Simulated Annealing is a probabilistic optimization algorithm inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. Key concepts include:

- Cooling schedules
- Probability of acceptance
- Energy states
- Applications in global optimization

### Genetic Algorithms (GA)

Genetic Algorithms are search heuristics inspired by the process of natural selection. Key concepts include:

- Population and chromosomes
- Selection, crossover, and mutation
- Fitness functions
- Applications in optimization and search problems

### Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a subset of AI focused on developing algorithms that enable computers to learn from and make predictions based on data. Key concepts include:

- Supervised and unsupervised learning
- Neural networks and deep learning
- Feature engineering
- Model evaluation and validation
